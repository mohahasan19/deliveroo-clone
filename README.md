# Deliveroo Clone

This is a clone of the food delivery app, Deliveroo, built in React Native. The project replicates the front-end functionality of the app by pulling data from a Sanity database. The app provides functionality for browsing restaurants, each of which is a functional component, and allows users to make orders by adding them to a basket. Users can add, remove, or modify their orders from the basket screen, after which they can place their orders for delivery, signalled by the navigation to a delivery screen. The basket is managed using Redux, a global state manager, and React Native Navigation is used to navigate between different screens.
